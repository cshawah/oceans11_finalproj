				<h1>Major Differences</h1>
				<h2>Studying the Gendered Breakdown of American Higher Education</h2>
				<h5><br>Makayla Nyambura, Chloe Shawah, Marika Thompson, and Tito Yak</h5>
				<br> <br>
				<p>Every year in the U.S., about 2 million college students graduate with Bachelor’s degrees — but not all Bachelor’s degrees are created equal. Each student must make a decision about what major to study, and we wanted to dive into what future impacts this decision might have. To answer this question, we’re making use of FiveThirtyEight’s College Majors Dataset, compiled from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Series in 2010-2012.</p>

			<h4>Distribution of Major Categories Among Recent Graduates</h4>
			<div class="col col-md-4">
				<h6>All Recent Graduates</h6>

			</div>
			<p>First, we looked at a simple question: What do recent graduates major in? Each bubble above represents 1% of college graduates, colored by their major. A quick scan of all recent graduates appears unassuming, but when we create split the data by gender, we begin to see some major differences.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-md-12">
				<h4>Gender Differences by Major Category</h4>
				<div id="gender_diffs_bars">
				</div>
				<br> <br>
				<p>We can see that major categories such as Health, Education, and Psychology & Social work are over 75% female, conforming to the societal expectation that women tend to be more nurturing and maternal. On the other hand, some STEM categories such as Engineering and Computer Science are heavily dominated by men, while fields such as Social Science and Law & Public Policy see a more equal split. This confirms that bachelor’s degrees are not distributed equally across genders. But tangibly, what does this mean?</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-md-12">
				<h4>Employment Differences by Major Category</h4>
				<div id="employment">
					<canvas id="employment_diffs" ></canvas>
				</div>
				<p>Regardless of the college major category, the majority of graduating students work a full-time job. However, we can see that not all major categories have the same employment outcomes post-grad. Biology & Life Sciences, for example, only has a 53% full-time employment rate, and Arts only has 58%, along with Humanities & Liberal Arts. In general, the highest rates of unemployment and part time work are for social science and humanities related majors. On the other end of the spectrum, students that major in Agriculture & Natural Resources secure full-time employment at a rate of 77%, and Business at 76%. Every major category that has more men than women has a full-time employment rate of nearly 70% or higher.</p>

			<p>Median incomes of recent graduates vary by quite a bit by major, and even by major category. Overall, nearly all of the majors with the top 20 highest median incomes are in the Engineering category. However, this category has historically fewer women than other major categories. Categories such as Education, with higher shares of women, have much lower post-graduation median incomes.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<h4>Gender Distribution Versus Median Income</h4>
			<div class="col col-md-12">
				<div id="gender_salary_bars">
				</div>
				<p><br> <br>The trend here is clear: the higher the percentage of women in a major, the lower the median income for that particular major. This is also reflected in major categories; the Engineering majors (shown in dark red) have much lower percentages of women than Psychology & Social Work (dark purple) majors. This trend is consistent with what was shown in the distribution of major categories over students: it seems that Psychology & Social Work majors are more likely to appeal to women than Engineering majors, implying that more needs to be done to encourage more women to pursue careers in these fields. Additionally, considering how drastic the difference in median income is between majors with larger shares of women and those without, perhaps jobs that already have higher shares of women should have higher incomes. </p>

		<div class="row">

			<p>Gender inequalities in career path, and therefore income, exist even from the very beginning of college graduates' careers. </p>
